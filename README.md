# 🔋 attiny85-vehicle-charge-monitor

**Monitors the health and status of a vehicle's 12V charging system using an ATtiny85 microcontroller and LED indicators.**

This repository contains the source code (Arduino C++) and hardware schematics for a compact, low-cost charging system monitor. It is designed to quickly alert the driver to potential issues like a failing alternator (undercharge) or voltage regulator failure (overcharge).
